# Steganography
Group Project #1 Steganography

### Description

Steganography is a technique used to conceal hidden messages in plain sight, where outsiders are unaware that there even is a message.

This program makes minor adjustments to each pixel of a PPM image, concealing information within the color values of the pixels.  Ideally, the difference between the original and modified image should not be discernable to the human eye.

### Compiling

Compile all cpp/h files with GNU C++ Compiler (g++).

### Execution

TODO

### How the Work was Shared

Some discussions via chat over discord. Matt provided the intital main.cpp file, the completed .h file, the cleanImage(), getNthBit(), encipher(), and decipher() methods, .gitignore file, and the initial README.md file. Waiting for Jalen to contribute to continue the project.
